The brain is a complex organ that serves as the central control center of the human body. It's responsible for a wide range of functions, from regulating basic bodily processes to enabling higher-level cognitive abilities like thought, memory, and emotions. The brain works by receiving, processing, and sending information through a vast network of nerve cells called neurons.

# The parts of the brain :

**Cerebrum**: The largest part of the brain, divided into two hemispheres, responsible for higher-level functions like language, reasoning, and voluntary movement.

**Cerebellum**: Located at the back of the brain, it coordinates movement, posture, and balance.

**Brainstem**: Connects the cerebrum to the spinal cord, controlling basic life functions like breathing, heart rate, and sleep.

# Heart

The heart is a vital muscular organ about the size of a fist that pumps blood throughout the body. It is located in the chest, slightly to the left of the breastbone, between the lungs. The heart has four chambers and four valves that regulate blood flow. It works as a pump, circulating blood to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the body and remove waste products.

# The parts of the heart:

**Chambers:**

Right Atrium: Receives oxygen-poor blood from the body.

Left Atrium: Receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs.

Right Ventricle: Pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs.

Left Ventricle: Pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.

**Valves:**

Tricuspid Valve: Between the right atrium and right ventricle.

Pulmonary Valve: Between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery.

Mitral Valve: Between the left atrium and left ventricle.

Aortic Valve: Between the left ventricle and aorta.

**Heart Wall:**

Epicardium: The outer layer.

Myocardium: The muscular middle layer.

Endocardium: The inner lining.

# Lungs

The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the breastbone in the chest cavity. They are the primary organs of the respiratory system, responsible for taking in oxygen from the air and transferring it to the blood, while also removing carbon dioxide from the blood and expelling it from the body.

**Function:**

Gas Exchange:

The lungs facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and the blood. 
Oxygenation:

Oxygen from inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli into the blood, which is then carried to the rest of the body. 
Carbon Dioxide Removal:

Carbon dioxide, a waste product of the body's metabolism, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli and is then exhaled. 
Other Functions:

The lungs also play a role in filtering out small particles and pathogens from the inhaled air and contribute to the body's acid-base balance. 

# The parts of the lungs:

**Right Lung**: Has three lobes (upper, middle, and lower). 

**Left Lung**: Has two lobes (upper and lower). 

**Lobes**: Sections of the lung separated by fissures (infoldings of the pleura). 

**Segments:** Lobes are further divided into segments, and segments into lobules.


**Airways**:

**Trachea**: (Windpipe): Connects the larynx to the bronchi. 

**Bronchi**: The trachea divides into two main bronchi, one for each lung. 

**Bronchioles**: The bronchi branch into smaller and smaller bronchioles.

**Alveoli**: Tiny air sacs at the end of the bronchioles where gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide) takes place. 

# Liver

The liver is a vital organ in the human body, playing a crucial role in digestion, detoxification, and metabolism. It's the largest internal organ, located in the upper right abdomen, and performs over 500 essential functions. 
The liver filters blood, removing toxins like alcohol and drugs, and breaking down waste products. 
It produces bile, which aids in fat digestion, and regulates the passage of nutrients into the bloodstream. 
The liver processes proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, storing energy and producing essential proteins. 
It regulates blood sugar levels, produces blood clotting factors, and destroys old red blood cells. 
The liver stores vitamins and minerals for later use by the body. 

# The parts of the liver:

**Right Lobe**: The largest lobe, making up roughly 5/6 of the liver's mass. 

**Left Lobe**: A smaller, flattened lobe compared to the right lobe. 

**Caudate Lobe**: Located on the posterior side of the right lobe, near the inferior vena cava. 

**Quadrate Lobe**: Situated on the inferior surface of the right lobe, near the gallbladder. 

# Stomach

<img width="263" height="191" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd7e04ea-1edc-48c0-8d1c-e44187fff073" />

The stomach is a muscular, J-shaped organ in the upper abdomen that plays a key role in digestion. It acts as a food reservoir, mixing ingested food with digestive juices to create chyme, a thick liquid that is then passed on to the small intestine. 
The stomach is located in the upper left abdomen, beneath the diaphragm. 
It connects the esophagus (food pipe) to the small intestine. 
It's a muscular, hollow organ with a capacity of about 1.5 to 2 liters. 
It has several parts: the fundus, body, antrum, and pylorus. 
The stomach wall is made up of four layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscle layer, and serosa. 
Temporary storage: The stomach holds food and liquids after they are swallowed. 
Mechanical digestion: The stomach's muscular walls churn and mix food with digestive juices. 
Chemical digestion: Digestive juices, including hydrochloric acid and enzymes like pepsin, break down proteins. 
Regulation of passage: The stomach controls the release of chyme into the small intestine. 
Secretion of intrinsic factor: This substance is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption in the small intestine. 

# Parts of the stomach:

**Cardia:**
This is the upper portion of the stomach, where the esophagus connects. It's the first area food enters when it passes from the esophagus into the stomach. 

**Fundus:**
Located superior to the cardia, the fundus is a dome-shaped area that can expand to hold food. 

**Body:**
This is the largest section of the stomach, located between the fundus and the pylorus.

**Pylorus:**
The pylorus is the lower, funnel-shaped part of the stomach that connects to the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The pylorus also includes the pyloric antrum and the pyloric canal, which leads to the pyloric sphincter. The pyloric sphincter controls the release of stomach contents into the small intestine. 

# Intestine

The intestine, also known as the bowel, is a long, muscular tube in the digestive system that extends from the stomach to the anus. It's divided into two main sections: the small intestine and the large intestine. The intestine's primary function is to digest food and absorb nutrients, but it also plays roles in hormone production, immune defense, and regulating water balance.

# **Small Intestine:**

**Location and Length:**
The small intestine is a long, winding tube, roughly 3 to 5 meters (10 to 16.5 feet) long in a living person. It's located between the stomach and the large intestine and is composed of three sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. 

**Function:**
The small intestine is where most of the digestion and nutrient absorption occurs. Enzymes break down food into smaller molecules (like sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids) that can be absorbed into the bloodstream
. 
**Key Features:**
The inner wall of the small intestine is folded, and covered in tiny finger-like projections called villi and microvilli, which greatly increase the surface area for absorption.

**Digestive Process:**
The small intestine receives partially digested food from the stomach and further breaks it down with digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and its own secretions. It then absorbs water and nutrients into the bloodstream.


# Large Intestine:

**Location and Length:**
The large intestine is shorter and wider than the small intestine, forming a frame around it. It's about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long. 

**Function:**
The large intestine primarily absorbs water and electrolytes from the remaining undigested material, turning it into stool. It also produces and absorbs some vitamins and stores the stool until it's eliminated from the body. 

**Sections:**
The large intestine is made up of the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal. 

**Digestive Process:**
The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes from the waste material, compacting it into stool. Peristalsis (muscle contractions) moves the stool through the colon, into the rectum for storage, and finally out of the body through the anus.
